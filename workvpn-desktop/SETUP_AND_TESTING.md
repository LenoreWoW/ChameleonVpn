# BarqNet Desktop - Setup and Testing Guide

## Prerequisites

### 1. OpenVPN Installation

The application requires OpenVPN to be installed on your system.

#### macOS
```bash
# Using Homebrew
brew install openvpn

# Verify installation
which openvpn
# Should output: /usr/local/bin/openvpn or /opt/homebrew/bin/openvpn
```

#### Windows
1. Download OpenVPN from https://openvpn.net/community-downloads/
2. Install to default location: `C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\`
3. Run installer as Administrator

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openvpn
```

### 2. Node.js and npm
- Node.js v16 or higher
- npm v8 or higher

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
cd barqnet-desktop

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build TypeScript
npm run build
```

## Running the Application

### Development Mode
```bash
npm start
```

This will:
1. Compile TypeScript files
2. Copy HTML/CSS assets
3. Start Electron in development mode

### Production Build

#### macOS (.dmg)
```bash
npm run make
```
Output: `out/make/` directory

- [ ] CPU usage is minimal when idle
- [ ] Stats update every second without lag
- [ ] UI remains responsive during connection
- [ ] No memory leaks after multiple connect/disconnect cycles

## Sample Test .ovpn File

Create a file named `test-config.ovpn` for testing:

```ovpn
client
dev tun
proto udp
remote vpn.example.com 1194
resolv-retry infinite
nobind
persist-key
persist-tun
cipher AES-256-CBC
auth SHA256
verb 3

<ca>
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
[Your CA Certificate Here]
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
</ca>

<cert>
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
[Your Client Certificate Here]
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
</cert>

<key>
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
[Your Private Key Here]
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
</key>
```

**Note**: Replace the certificate placeholders with actual certificates from your OpenVPN server.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "OpenVPN binary not found"
**Solution**: Install OpenVPN using the instructions above

### Issue: "Permission denied" when connecting
**macOS Solution**:
```bash
sudo npm start
# OR grant permissions to openvpn binary
```

**Windows Solution**: Run app as Administrator

### Issue: App doesn't start
**Solution**:
1. Check console for errors: `npm start`
2. Verify all dependencies installed: `npm install`
3. Rebuild: `npm run build`

### Issue: Config import fails
**Solution**:
1. Verify .ovpn file is valid
2. Check file contains required fields: `remote`, `ca`
3. Ensure file is UTF-8 encoded

### Issue: Connection fails
**Solution**:
1. Verify OpenVPN server is accessible
2. Check firewall settings
3. Review OpenVPN logs in app console

## Debugging

### View Console Logs
Development mode automatically opens DevTools. Check:
- Main process logs: Terminal output
- Renderer process logs: DevTools console
- OpenVPN logs: Look for `[OpenVPN]` prefix

### Enable Verbose Logging
Edit `src/main/vpn/manager.ts`:
```typescript
this.process = spawn(openvpnBinary, [
  '--config', configPath,
  '--verb', '5'  // Change from 3 to 5 for verbose
]);
```

## Next Steps After macOS Testing

Once all tests pass on macOS at 100%:
1. Move to Windows testing
2. Build Windows installer
3. Test on Windows 10/11
4. Move to Platform 2 (iOS)

## Completion Criteria

**Platform 1 is considered 100% complete when**:
- âœ… All Phase 1-7 tests pass
- âœ… macOS .dmg builds successfully
- âœ… Windows .exe builds successfully
- âœ… Connection works on both platforms
- âœ… No critical bugs
- âœ… Performance meets requirements
