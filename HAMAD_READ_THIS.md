# üöÄ HAMAD - START HERE

**Hey Hamad!** This guide will walk you through testing the complete BarqNet VPN application across all platforms.

---

## üìã What You're Testing

You have **4 components** to test:

1. **Backend API** (Go) - The server that handles authentication
2. **Desktop Client** (Electron) - Windows/macOS/Linux app
3. **iOS Client** (Swift) - iPhone/iPad app
4. **Android Client** (Kotlin) - Android phones/tablets app

---

## ‚ö° Quick Start Checklist

Before you start, make sure you have:

- [ ] Git installed
- [ ] Go 1.21+ installed (for backend)
- [ ] PostgreSQL 14+ installed (for backend)
- [ ] Node.js 18+ installed (for Desktop client)
- [ ] Xcode 15+ installed (for iOS client - macOS only)
- [ ] Android Studio installed (for Android client)

---

## üéØ STEP 1: Get the Latest Code

```bash
# Clone the repository (if you haven't already)
git clone https://github.com/LenoreWoW/ChameleonVpn.git
cd ChameleonVpn

# Or pull latest changes (if you already have it)
git pull origin main
```

**‚úÖ Expected:** Code downloads successfully

---

## üóÑÔ∏è STEP 2: Set Up Backend (Management API Server)

**This is the most important step!** All clients need the backend to work.

### On Windows (PowerShell):

#### 2.1: Install PostgreSQL (if not installed)
```powershell
# Install using winget
winget install PostgreSQL.PostgreSQL

# Verify installation
psql --version
```

#### 2.2: Create Database
```powershell
# Set password environment variable
$env:PGPASSWORD = "postgres"

# Create database and user
psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE barqnet;"
psql -U postgres -c "CREATE USER barqnet WITH PASSWORD 'barqnet123';"
psql -U postgres -c "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE barqnet TO barqnet;"
```

**‚úÖ Expected:** You see "CREATE DATABASE" and "GRANT" messages

#### 2.3: Install Go (if not installed)
```powershell
# Install using winget
winget install GoLang.Go

# Verify installation
go version
```

**‚úÖ Expected:** Shows Go version 1.21 or higher

#### 2.4: Build the Backend
```powershell
# Navigate to backend folder
cd barqnet-backend

# Download dependencies
go mod download

# Build Management Server
go build -o management.exe .\apps\management
```

**‚úÖ Expected:** File `management.exe` is created with no errors

#### 2.5: Run Database Migrations
```powershell
# Navigate to migrations folder
cd migrations

# Set database connection string
$env:DATABASE_URL = "postgres://barqnet:barqnet123@localhost/barqnet?sslmode=disable"

# Run migrations
go run run_migrations.go
```

**‚úÖ Expected Output:**
```
Connected to database successfully
Running migrations...
‚úì Migration 002_add_phone_auth.sql
‚úì Migration 003_add_statistics.sql
‚úì Migration 004_add_locations.sql
All migrations completed successfully!
```

#### 2.6: Start the Backend Server
```powershell
# Go back to backend folder
cd ..

# Set environment variables
$env:DATABASE_URL = "postgres://barqnet:barqnet123@localhost/barqnet?sslmode=disable"
$env:JWT_SECRET = "your-secret-key-change-in-production"
$env:PORT = "8080"
$env:ENABLE_OTP_CONSOLE = "true"

# Start the server
.\management.exe
```

**‚úÖ Expected Output:**
```
Starting BarqNet Management Server...
Database connected successfully
Server listening on :8080
```

**üéâ KEEP THIS TERMINAL OPEN!** The server must keep running while you test the clients.

#### 2.7: Test the Backend (Open NEW Terminal)
```powershell
# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8080/api/health
```

**‚úÖ Expected Response:**
```json
{"status":"healthy","timestamp":1234567890}
```

**üéâ If you see this, your backend is working perfectly!**

---

### On macOS/Linux:

#### 2.1: Install PostgreSQL
```bash
# macOS
brew install postgresql@14
brew services start postgresql@14

# Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
sudo systemctl start postgresql
```

#### 2.2: Create Database
```bash
# Create database
sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE DATABASE barqnet;"
sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE USER barqnet WITH PASSWORD 'barqnet123';"
sudo -u postgres psql -c "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE barqnet TO barqnet;"
```

#### 2.3: Build and Run Backend
```bash
cd barqnet-backend

# Download dependencies
go mod download

# Build
go build -o management ./apps/management

# Run migrations

## üêõ Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Backend Won't Start

**Error:** `pq: password authentication failed`

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Recreate database user
psql -U postgres -c "ALTER USER barqnet WITH PASSWORD 'barqnet123';"
```

---

### Issue 2: Backend Won't Start - Port Already in Use

**Error:** `bind: address already in use`

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Windows: Find what's using port 8080
netstat -ano | findstr :8080

# Kill the process (replace PID with the number you see)
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Then restart backend
.\management.exe
```

---

### Issue 3: Desktop Client Shows "Network Error"

**Error:** `Failed to connect to backend`

**Solution:**
1. **Verify backend is running:**
   ```powershell
   curl http://localhost:8080/api/health
   ```
   Should return: `{"status":"healthy",...}`

2. **Check Windows Firewall:**
   ```powershell
   # Allow port 8080
   New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "BarqNet API" -Direction Inbound -LocalPort 8080 -Protocol TCP -Action Allow
   ```

---

### Issue 4: iOS App Can't Connect (Real Device)

**Error:** `Request failed` or `Connection refused`

**Solution:**
1. **Make sure you're using your computer's IP, not localhost**
   ```bash
   # Get your IP
   ipconfig getifaddr en0
   ```

2. **Update iOS config** in `WorkVPN/Config/Config.swift`:
   ```swift
   static let apiBaseURL = "http://YOUR-COMPUTER-IP:8080"
   ```

3. **Make sure iPhone and computer are on the same Wi-Fi network**

4. **Check firewall** allows incoming connections on port 8080

---

### Issue 5: Android Emulator Can't Connect

**Error:** `java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused`

**Solution:**
Use the special emulator IP:
```kotlin
// In ApiConfig.kt
const val BASE_URL = "http://10.0.2.2:8080"
```

**Not** `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` - emulator requires `10.0.2.2`

---

### Issue 6: No OTP Code Appearing

**Error:** OTP code doesn't show in backend console

**Solution:**
1. **Check environment variable is set:**
   ```powershell
   $env:ENABLE_OTP_CONSOLE = "true"
   ```

2. **Restart backend** after setting the variable

3. **Check phone number format:**
   - Must include country code with `+`: `+1234567890`
   - NOT valid: `1234567890` (missing +)

---

### Issue 7: Go Build Errors

**Error:** `package not found` or `import errors`

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Clean and rebuild
cd barqnet-backend
go clean
go mod tidy
go mod download
go build -o management.exe .\apps\management
```

---

### Issue 8: PostgreSQL Not Running

**Windows:**
```powershell
# Check service
Get-Service -Name postgresql*

# Start if stopped
Start-Service postgresql-x64-14
```

**macOS:**
```bash
brew services start postgresql@14
```

**Linux:**
```bash
sudo systemctl start postgresql
```
